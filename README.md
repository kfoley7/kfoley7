- 👋 Hi, I’m @kfoley7
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole lot of things like outdoor activities and SW development, and there's too much to list, but for now, Go and AWS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with Go, Kubernetes, and AWS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff I'd work on at Wasabi.
- 📫 How to reach me for non-work items is kevmonstah@gmail.com
